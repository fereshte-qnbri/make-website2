            I think this might just be one of my new favourite puddings.
            Recently, I saw a something labelled as a “croissant cake” in a
            local cafe and thought it sounded delicious, so set myself the task
            of writing a recipe for one. I’ve never tried a croissant cake
            before so was starting from a totally clean slate, and I’m pretty
            pleased with the final result – the first mouthful was a bit of an
            “oh my god” moment, if I do say so myself. There’s nothing difficult
            or skilled about this dessert – it’s just a delicious combination of
            buttery, layered croissants, tart summer berries and cherries, and
            classic vanilla custard.

            It’s very similar in principle to a bread and butter pudding, but
            presentationally, I think it looks great as a standalone cake. All
            you need to do is make the custard and then assemble the layers and
            bake. This makes it perfect for a dinner party recipe, where you
            need to be able to focus on the guests and the other courses,
            without too much extra work.

            You need good quality vanilla for the custard, and it is really
            important to allow it time to soak into the croissants. This recipe
            is also a great way to use up croissants which are slightly past
            their best. If you wanted to make the flavours more complex, you
            could add a slug of liqueur to the custard for that after-dinner
            finish. This cake will keep for up to three days in the fridge, but
            is best eaten on the day of making.
